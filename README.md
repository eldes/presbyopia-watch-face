# Presbyopia Watch Face

This is a watch face app for Garmin devices.

The idea is to develop a design that allows you to see, without the need for glasses, the essential information on the Garmin watch face.

For this purpose, a family of readable typefaces was selected, mainly in relation to numerical digits, and the layout was thought of in such a way as to accommodate the largest size for the characters, within the restricted space of the screen.
